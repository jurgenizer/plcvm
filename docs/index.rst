=============================
Welcome to VirtualMicroscope
=============================

`VirtualMicroscope <https://github.com/evildmp/VirtualMicroscope>`_ is a Python/Django application
to view, navigate and annotate very high-resolution images.

It was created at New York University School of Medicine for viewing medical slides for
teaching and research purposes, but in fact is suitable for exploring any high-resolution images -
from astronomy, museum collections, specialised photographic applications and so on.

The application was written by William Holloway and Marc Triola of NYU, where it has been used sucessfully and written up in `Enhanced virtual microscopy for collaborative education <http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6920/11/4>`_.

In January 2015 VirtualMicroscope was selected by a team at `NHS HackDay <http://nhshackday.com>`_ in Cardiff, to help make it easier to deploy and work with.

This version of VirtualMicroscope is a fork of the `original version hosted by NYU on Google Code
<https://code.google.com/p/virtualmicroscope/>`_.
