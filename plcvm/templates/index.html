	  <h4>About</h4>
	   <p>
        Virtual Microscope is a Python/Django application to view and annotate very high-resolution images.
	   </p>

	   <p>
        A virtual microscope relieves pressure on laboratories and equipment, and makes it possible to to collaborate remotely - without needing to transport precious slides or colleagues.
	   </p>

	   <p>
        It was created at <a href="http://dei.med.nyu.edu" target="_blank"> New York University School of Medicine </a> for teaching and research purposes but the basic principle is suitable for exploring any high-resolution images - from astronomy, museum collections, etc.
	   </p>

	   <p>
        NYU's application was <a href="http://code.google.com/p/virtualmicroscope/" target="_blank">open-sourced</a> but has languished; Cardiff University School of Medicine and NHS hackday have brought the project up-to-date, packaged it and added <a href="https://readthedocs.org/projects/virtualmicroscope/">documentation</a>, making it easier to get started with and more attractive to developers.
	   </p>

     <p>
        Virtual Microscope is <a href="https://github.com/evildmp/VirtualMicroscope">hosted on GitHub.</a>
	   </p>

     <p>
        This particular implementation is by the <a href="http://www.digitalpathology.uct.ac.za/" target="_blank">UCT Pathology Learning Centre</a> and should be considered experimental. (It may have bugs!)
     </p>

     <p>
		The Virtual Microscope allows both learners and faculty to annotate slides with community peer-review.  It includes a practical exam system, and each slide can include metadata from controlled vocabularies to classify and search for slides.  We have released the source code of the application as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/virtualmicroscope/" target="_blank">an open-source project on Google Code</a>.
